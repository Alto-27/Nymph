8 bit 6502 CPU
	- Runs at 1.79 MHz
	- 3 general purpose registers A/X/Y (All 8 bit)
	- 3 Special registers
		- P (status) 8 bit
		- SP (stack pointer) 8 bit
		- PC (program counter) 16 bit
	
2 KB onboard RAM
	- 16 bit addressable memory space
	- The other 62 KB is used for special I/O registers or cartridge ROM/RAM space if used at all

PPU (Picture processing unit)
	- 256 x 240 screen
	- 8x8 tiles for background
	- Up to 64 8x8 or 8x16 sprites for moving objects
	- Pixel scrolling
	
APU (Audio Processing Unit)
	- 2 pulse channels
	- 1 triangle channel
	- 1 noise channel
	- 1 DMC (delta modulation) channel
	
Controllers
	- Up, down, left, right, A, B, select, start
	
Cartridge boards + mappers
	- Special hardware for each

Need to learn:

CPU --> instructions, addressing modes, registers and status flags, interrupts
PPU --> PPU registers, pattern table, name table, sprites, rendering pipeline, and scrolling
APU --> APU registers, and how to generate square/triangle waves
iNES format --> most roms are in this format
